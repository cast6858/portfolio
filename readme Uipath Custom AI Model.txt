In my UiPath project, emails are categorized using machine learning techniques, using Random Forest algorithm. I created this project with the intention of enhancing email management effectiveness for businesses that process a lot of emails.

For the automation of email classification, I designed a precise folder structure in UiPath to accomplish this. I combined the AI model with UiPath to automate the classification and grouping of emails into spam and not- spam. I have provide the PY and pickle files, to effectively run program in AI Center.

There are significant advantages include greater accuracy, decreased errors, and increased efficiency when machine learning techniques are integrated with UiPath. Through this initiative, businesses may automate their email categorization and organization procedures, saving time and resources that can be put to better use.

In conclusion, my UiPath project is a useful addition to any business that manages a lot of email. I developed an effective and automated method of handling email correspondence using a custom machine learning algorithm.
