This project goes into making a predictive model for loan approvals. I started by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, which involved analyzing the data to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

Using the insights gained from the EDA, I proceeded to develop a predictive model using logistic regression and random forest models. To optimize the performance of the models, I employed techniques like standard scalar and principal component analysis (PCA). To evaluate the performance of the models, I created ROC (receiver operating characteristic) plots and confusion matrices.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into the loan approval process and to help improve its accuracy through the use of advanced modeling techniques. By using EDA and applying logistic regression and random forest models, I have created a predictive model that can accurately predict loan approvals based of characteristics.
